# Health Literacy Assistant App

This is a bilingual Streamlit app designed to help users interpret common health metrics such as **Body Mass Index (BMI)**, **blood pressure**, **fasting glucose**, and **waist circumference**. The app delivers plain-language explanations and links to trusted public health sources in both **English** and **Spanish**.

This project was created by a student with an interest in health literacy, community outreach, and digital tools that empower patients to better understand their own health data.
