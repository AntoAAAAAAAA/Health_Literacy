st.text('This project was a nice break from data-related work. It focused more on the Python language and the use of Streamlit. In my opinion, this dashboard helped expand my knowledge of Streamlit’s various capabilities and features. In particular, learning Streamlit’s session_state feature was incredibly useful for creating the language toggle. I’ve used a language toggle in previous projects, but this time I was aided by AI in creating specific functions that helped make the toggle cleaner.')

st.text('In addition, developing a system to keep values in their respective input boxes, even when the user switches to a new page, was a novel experience for me. The logic behind this was really interesting (specifically, the creation of a session_state dictionary called results that stored input values). This implementation was, in my opinion, a major improvement over my previous projects.')

st.text('This project was also significant because of how much more emphasis there was on the actual content compared to the code. The dashboard taught me a lot about basic health metrics and how to address conditions like obesity, being underweight, excessive body fat, high blood pressure, etc. Although the project took longer than expected due to personal reasons and external delays, I wish I could have included additional health metrics. Still, I’m happy with the ones I did include and believe the information provided was strong.')

st.text('Overall, this project leaned more toward research than coding. I felt that the core of the dashboard emphasized what the user was reading in the Results section more than the calculation of BMI, for example. That said, the calculations and back-end logic were by far the most interesting part for me. I loved the process of taking user input, classifying it, storing it, running calculations, saving results in session_state, and pulling those values into different contexts for analysis.')

st.text('Overall, I felt this project was a huge success. The only downside was that it didn’t meet my expectations for aesthetics. I wish it looked better. Unfortunately, I felt limited in my front-end development due to my lack of knowledge in HTML and Markdown. That being said, these are two tools I hope to incorporate more into future projects to improve visual design.')

st.text('I’m very proud of the progress I’ve made with Streamlit and Python. I think this project was a step back in complexity compared to my data-related projects, but it helped boost my confidence in front-end aesthetics, basic calculations, use of session_state, and my overall understanding of Streamlit app development. I hope to continue building on this progress in future projects and keep adding to my skillset.')
